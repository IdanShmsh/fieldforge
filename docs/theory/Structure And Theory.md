# Structure And Theory

This document expands on the structural design, theoretical foundations, and practical implementations of the FieldForge simulation platform.

## Modular Architecture

FieldForge is designed around a modular, extensible core structure. This modularity allows users to experiment with different implementations of identical theoretical processes, exploring variations in:

- **Complexity and precision** (simple approximations vs. high-order numerical schemes)
- **Optimization strategies** (performance-focused GPU computing, memory optimization, etc.)
- **Numerical approaches** (finite-difference methods, leapfrog integration, Wilson line implementations, and others)

All implementations are integrated through a unified compute-shader pipeline, providing precise real-time control over simulation dynamics and visualizations.

## Lattice-Based Simulation Model

At the heart of FieldForge’s computational approach are **field lattice buffers**, discrete data structures representing quantum-inspired fields at every lattice site. Each lattice site encodes:

- **Fermion fields**: Stored as color-charged Dirac spinors, each represented by an array of 12 complex numbers, corresponding to the product of 4 spinor components × 3 color charge states.
- **Gauge fields, Electric and Magnetic Strength Fields**: Stored as packs of 12 four-vectors, each representing a gauge symmetry aligned with the 12 gauge symmetries of the Standard Model.

### Temporal Buffer Structure

For stability and accuracy, FieldForge maintains a three-layered buffer structure at each lattice site, explicitly handling three distinct temporal instances simultaneously:

- **Previous**: The field states from the prior timestep.
- **Current**: The presently evolving state of the fields.
- **Next**: The calculated, future state based on theoretical dynamical equations.

This approach facilitates stable, numerically precise evolution of field configurations across discrete time intervals.

## Simulation Parameters

FieldForge employs a clearly defined set of simulation parameters governing all aspects of runtime behavior and visualization, including:

- **Spatial Dimensions**: Lattice points along the simulation axes (width, height, depth).
- **Spatial (dx) and Temporal (dt) Resolution**: Discretization units controlling numerical accuracy and computational load.
- **Interaction Couplings**: Numerical constants defining interaction strengths for gauge fields and their self-interactions.
- **Field Density Constraints**: Numerical upper bounds for fermion and gauge fields, ensuring stable numerical behavior.
- **Visualization Settings**: Parameters adjusting field visibility and brightness to control visual outputs.
- **Field-Specific Properties**: Fermion mass parameters, color coding, coupling constants, and rendering attributes.

## Example: Implementing Dynamics of a Free Fermion Field

To concretely illustrate the process of translating theoretical equations into practical simulation logic, consider a simple example - the evolution of a free fermion field governed by the Dirac equation:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu&space;-&space;im)\psi=0" />
</p>

Initially, the temporal derivative of the fermion field would be isolated:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\partial_0\psi=\gamma^0(im&space;-&space;\gamma^i\partial_i)\psi" />
</p>

Then, given the theory fully outlined and prepared for implementation, a practical FieldForge implementation might follow the following steps:

- **Compute Spatial Derivatives**: Approximate spatial derivatives at each lattice point via finite-difference methods using neighboring lattice states.
- **Gamma Matrix Application**: Multiply computed spatial derivatives by respective gamma matrices numerically.
- **Integrate Mass Term**: Include fermion mass contribution at each lattice site by multiplying the local state by its mass parameter.
- **Derive Temporal Derivative**: Combine mass terms and gamma-weighted derivatives into a single computed temporal derivative for each lattice site.
- **Apply Leapfrog Update**: Determine the next-state fermion configuration at each lattice site, matching finite-difference-calculated temporal derivatives to the theoretically obtained values.

This numerical procedure ensures a robust, stable, and theoretically consistent fermion field evolution.

## Flexibility and Extensibility

The outlined examples illustrate one potential method for simulating quantum-inspired dynamics within FieldForge. The modular infrastructure allows for an extensive variety of approaches, limited only by adherence to FieldForge’s basic structural requirements. Researchers and developers are encouraged to explore alternate formalisms, numerical methods, and optimization strategies.
