# FieldForge

**What would quantum fields look like if we could *see* them without *observing* them?** 👀✨

**FieldForge** exists to explore exactly that.

FieldForge is a *real-time* simulation platform for exploring quantum fields - *visually* 🎨, *interactively* 🕹️, and *structurally* 🧱.

To make this possible, FieldForge intentionally abandons two defining features of quantum theory:

- ❌ **No quantization** - fields are treated as continuous, *deterministic* entities.
- ❌ **No measurement** - there is no collapse, no projection; the fields evolve *unobserved*.

This means FieldForge is **not** a scientific modeling tool in the strict sense. Instead, it is:

- 🧪 A **research ground** for experimenting with quantum-inspired dynamics, symmetries, and interactions.
- 🧰 A **modular platform** for implementing and/or configuring any formulation, modification, or reinterpretation of quantum field behavior.
- 🔧 A **development environment** where simulation logic can be extended, replaced, or entirely reimagined — from first principles to visual output.

FieldForge is designed for those who want to probe the structure of quantum fields without the constraints of measurement or quantization.
